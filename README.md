# Nancy-Self-Hosted-Web-Service
For assignment 8 for COMPSCI 335 (Functional Programming and Distributed Services), I developed a Nancy Self Hosted Web Service. This was completed based off of the assignment brief ([A8 Assignment Brief.pdf](https://github.com/nmar332/Nancy-Self-Hosted-Web-Service/files/7536650/A8.Assignment.Brief.pdf)
) along with the bare skeleteon code provided.
